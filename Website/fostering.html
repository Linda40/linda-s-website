<h1>Fostering a pet</h1>

<p>Why would you want to foster a dog?</p>
<p>By fostering any animal, you are helping to save their lives, by removing them from shelters. As a foster parent you are helping us to understand the animal needs which in return will help with their adoption. As a foster parent you will be training them to enter a new home, by observing their behavior and training.
